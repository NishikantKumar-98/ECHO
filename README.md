# Energy Shield By Team ECHO
![Dashboard Preview](page-1.jpg)

## Project Overview

Energy Shield is an AI-powered power grid dashboard designed for **real-time monitoring**, **predictive analytics**, and **smart grid automation**. By leveraging **AI** and **IoT technologies**, Energy Shield enhances energy management, optimizes efficiency, and secures power grids against cyber threats.

### Problem Statement

Traditional power grid monitoring systems lack **predictive capabilities** and **automated responses** to fluctuations, faults, and security threats. Energy Shield addresses these challenges by offering:

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous data visualization, anomaly detection, and instant alerts.
- **Predictive Analytics**: AI-driven forecasting of energy consumption, fault detection, and theft identification.
- **Smart Grid Automation**: Intelligent controls to optimize grid operations and prevent outages.
- **Security Features**: AI-based protection against cyber threats, unauthorized access, and data breaches.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend:

- **React.js** (for interactive UI and dashboards)
- **TailwindCSS** (for styling and responsive design)

### Backend:

- **Express.js** (Node.js framework for API handling)
- **MongoDB** (NoSQL database for storing energy metrics)
- **Python (Flask/Django)** (for AI model integration and API services)

### AI & Machine Learning:

- **TensorFlow, PyTorch** (for AI-driven anomaly detection and energy forecasting)
- **Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas** (for data preprocessing and statistical analysis)

### Cloud & IoT:

- **IoT Sensors** (Smart meters, voltage/current sensors for real-time energy data collection)
- **Apache Kafka** (for real-time data streaming and processing)
- **Cloud Deployment** (AWS/GCP/Azure for scalability and security)
